# Posting data with React

This is the demo code that belongs to https://github.com/Piepongwong/Week8/blob/master/Day1.md . After creating a beer, the api returns the beer we just created with it's objectId. We use this objectId to redirect the user to the detail page of the beer. We are redirecting programatically with `this.props.history.push`. `this.props.history.push` is added by react-router. In the BeerDetail page we are reading out the objectId from the params and query the api with it.
